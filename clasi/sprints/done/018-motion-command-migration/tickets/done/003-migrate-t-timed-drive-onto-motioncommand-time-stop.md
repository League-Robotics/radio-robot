# Migrate T timed-drive onto MotionCommand TIME stop

## Description

Replace `beginTimed`'s bespoke `_tEndMs` deadline + the `if (_mode == TIMED)` branch in
`driveAdvance` with a MotionCommand configured with a `TIME(durationMs)` stop condition.
Convert the `(L, R)` wheel-speed inputs to body twist `(v, ω)` via
`BodyKinematics::forward()` at begin, giving T profiled acceleration under body limits.
`EVT done T` wire contract preserved.

**Key changes:**
- `beginTimed`: call `BodyKinematics::forward(L, R, trackwidthMm, v, omega)` to get the
  body twist; configure `_activeCmd` with target `(v, omega)` and `makeTimeStop(durationMs)`;
  set `setDoneEvt("EVT done T")`; set SOFT style; capture reply sink + corr_id; call
  `_activeCmd.start(*_hwState, now_ms)`.
- Remove `startDriveClean`, direct `mc.setTarget`, `_tgtL/R` write-back, and `_tEndMs`
  assignment from `beginTimed`.
- Remove the `if (_mode == TIMED) { fullStop; emitEvt; }` block from `driveAdvance`.
- Remove `_tEndMs` member from `DriveController.h`.
- `_mode` set to `DriveMode::VELOCITY` (same as VW/R) so STREAMING watchdog does not fire.

**`BodyKinematics::forward(L, R, b, v, omega)`:**
Verify this method exists and has the correct signature. From source: `BodyKinematics.h:52`
documents `forward`. If the signature differs, adapt accordingly.

**EVT done T:** grep all tests (`test_motion_verbs_v2.py`, calibration scripts) for
`done T` before touching any emission path.

**`target.mode` / `target.corrId`:** After migration, `beginTimed` no longer writes
`target.deadlineMs`. The MotionCommand captures corrId; `target.corrId` can be cleared.
Ensure `target.mode = DriveMode::VELOCITY` is set so TLM shows mode=V for T drives
(mode character for VELOCITY is 'V' per AppContext).

Note: T calibration scripts (`calibrate_linear.py`, `calibrate_bench.py`) drive in a
straight line via T commands. After migration, T uses `forward()` to compute `(v, ω)`.
For equal L=R (straight drive), `forward` gives `v = (L+R)/2` and `omega = 0` —
no steer bias. Verify this is correct.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] `_tEndMs` member removed from `DriveController.h`/`.cpp`.
- [x] `EVT done T` wire format preserved (grep all test files for `done T` before editing).
- [x] Equal L=R inputs → no steer bias: `omega = 0` from `forward(L, L, ...)`.
- [x] T branch removed from `driveAdvance`.
- [x] `uv run --with pytest python -m pytest -q` passes at 1226/8 baseline (updated from 1179 — baseline confirmed 1226 pass / 8 known fail).
- [x] Clean build: `python3 build.py --clean` succeeds.
- [x] Existing T-related tests in `test_motion_verbs_v2.py` pass unchanged.
- [ ] On-robot bench (T drives for the duration, now ramps, stops with EVT done T) — stakeholder-deferred.

## Implementation Plan

### Files to modify
- `source/control/DriveController.h` — remove `uint32_t _tEndMs`
- `source/control/DriveController.cpp`:
  - Constructor: remove `_tEndMs(0)` initialiser
  - `beginTimed`: rewrite to call `forward()`, configure MotionCommand, start it;
    remove old `startDriveClean`/`setTarget`/`_tEndMs` lines; set `target.mode = VELOCITY`
  - `driveAdvance`: remove the `if (_mode == TIMED)` block entirely
- `source/app/CommandProcessor.cpp`: no change to T handler (wire format unchanged)

### Testing plan
- Grep `done T` in all test files and calibration scripts to locate all EVT assertions.
- Run `tests/dev/test_motion_verbs_v2.py` — must pass unchanged.
- Run full pytest suite.
- Bench (stakeholder-deferred): T 200 200 1000 drives for ~1 s and emits EVT done T;
  calibration scripts (`calibrate_linear.py`) produce same distance as pre-018.
