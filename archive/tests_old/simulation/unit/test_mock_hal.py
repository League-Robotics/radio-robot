test_mock_hal.py — tests for MockMotor physics and encoder injection.

MockMotor integrates commanded speed into encoder mm on each tick:
    encoderMm += (cmdSpeed / 100.0) * kNominalMaxMms * offsetFactor * (dt_ms / 1000.0)
where kNominalMaxMms = 400.0 mm/s.

Motor speed is set via the S command (left_mms right_mms dist_mm).  We use
VW (body velocity + angular velocity) to drive at a known forward speed with
no rotation, which sets both wheels at the requested body speed.
