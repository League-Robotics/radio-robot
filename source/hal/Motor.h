/**
 * Motor — I2C driver for one channel of the PlanetX Nezha V2 motor controller.
 *
 * I2C address: 0x10 (7-bit).
 *
 * Protocol verified against PlanetX pxt-nezha2/main.ts:
 *   Motor start (8-byte write):
 *     [0xFF, 0xF9, motorId, direction, 0x60, speed, 0xF5, 0x00]
 *     direction: 1=CW (forward from chip perspective), 2=CCW (reverse)
 *     speed: 0-100 (absolute)
 *
 *   Encoder read (8-byte write + 4-byte read):
 *     Write: [0xFF, 0xF9, motorId, 0x00, 0x46, 0x00, 0xF5, 0x00]
 *     Read:  4 bytes, signed int32 little-endian, units = tenths of degrees
 *
 *   Encoder zero is maintained in software (offset scalar), matching the
 *   TypeScript resetRelAngleValue() behaviour.
 *
 * Constructor args:
 *   motorId  — 1 = M1 (right wheel), 2 = M2 (left wheel)
 *   fwdSign  — +1 or -1; maps the logical "forward" command to chip direction.
 *              Right wheel requires -1 because the motor is mounted mirrored.
 *
 * Vendor register coverage (all 9 vendor-documented registers):
 *   Register | HAL Method                             | Sprint | Status
 *   ---------|----------------------------------------|--------|-------
