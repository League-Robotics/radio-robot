"""Serial connection management for micro:bit relay/direct devices.

Architecture (sprint 025, ticket 001):
---------------------------------------
SerialConnection owns the physical serial port and all I/O on it.  A single
background reader thread holds the only ``_ser.readline()`` call and
demultiplexes every incoming line into one of three queues:

- ``_reply_queues`` — keyed by corr-id; populated by the firmware's
  ``OK``/``ERR``/``CFG`` replies when the host appended ``#<id>`` to the
  command.  ``send()`` blocks on the corr-id-keyed queue entry it created
  before writing.
- ``_tlm_queue``   — bounded (256 frames); receives every ``TLM ...`` line.
  ``read_lines()`` and ``read_pending_lines()`` drain it.
- ``_evt_queue``   — unbounded; receives every ``EVT ...`` line.
  ``read_lines()`` and ``read_pending_lines()`` drain it; so does any caller
  of ``wait_for_evt_done()``.

Nothing outside ``SerialConnection`` reads from ``_ser`` directly.  The only
intentional internal ``_ser`` access points are:

- ``_banner_classify`` — ``write()`` / ``readline()`` during the pre-reader
                         HELLO classify handshake (before ``connect()`` returns).
- ``_relay_handshake``  — ``write()`` / ``readline()`` during the relay
                         ``!ECHO OFF`` / ``!MODE RAW250`` / ``!GO`` sequence,
                         also before the reader thread starts.
- ``_poll_ready``    — ``reset_input_buffer()``, ``write()``, ``readline()``
                       before the reader thread starts.
- ``_keepalive_loop`` — ``write()`` / ``flush()`` under ``_write_lock``.
- ``handshake()``   — ``write()`` / ``flush()`` under ``_write_lock``, before
                       the reader thread starts (device-detection phase only).
- ``_reader_loop``  — sole owner of ``readline()`` after ``connect()`` returns.

Connection handshake (sprint 036, ticket 007):
----------------------------------------------
``connect()`` now performs a HELLO-classify step before the reader thread starts:

1. The port is opened **with DTR asserted** (pyserial default).  DTR pulses on
   open-time close/reopen, resetting any micro:bit on the port and causing it to
   emit a ``DEVICE:`` announcement banner.  There is no ``dtr = False`` override.

2. ``_banner_classify()`` sends ``HELLO`` repeatedly (up to ~10 times, ~200 ms
   apart) and reads each response until it captures a ``DEVICE:<ROLE>:...`` line.
   Parsed ROLE determines the connection mode:

   - ``RADIOBRIDGE`` → relay; proceed to ``_relay_handshake()``.
   - ``NEZHA2``      → direct USB robot; skip to readiness poll.

3. ``_relay_handshake()`` sends ``!ECHO OFF``, ``!MODE RAW250``, then ``!GO``
   and waits for ``# entering data plane``.  After ``!GO`` the relay is a
   transparent byte pipe.  All subsequent traffic is **plain** (no ``>`` prefix).

4. After the handshake, ``connect()`` proceeds with the PING readiness poll, then
   starts the keepalive daemon and reader thread as before.  From the reader
   thread's perspective the relay connection is indistinguishable from direct: the
   same plain send, same ``+`` keepalive, same ``#<id>`` corr-id.

Radio channel note:
   The relay's channel, group, and mode persist in its flash.  Matching those
   values between the relay and the robot is a bench-setup concern, not managed
   here.  ``_banner_classify()`` queries ``?`` and logs the relay's reported
   channel/group/mode so mismatches are visible in verbose output.

Reader loop:
   Lines beginning with ``#`` are relay status/comment lines.  The reader loop
   drops them silently; they do not generate protocol errors.

        Handshake algorithm (sprint 036, ticket 007):

        1. Open the port with **DTR asserted** (pyserial default — no
           ``dtr = False`` override).  Opening the port toggles DTR, which
           resets any micro:bit (via the DAPLink) into a clean command plane.
           The relay then emits a ``DEVICE:`` boot announcement.  Without a
           reset (no DTR pulse) there is no boot banner; the classify step sends
           ``HELLO`` to request one explicitly.

        2. ``_banner_classify()`` sends ``HELLO`` repeatedly (up to the
           ``_HELLO_CLASSIFY_TIMEOUT_S`` budget) until a ``DEVICE:<ROLE>:...``
           line is captured.  The ``DEVICE:`` line is read RAW (before the
           reader thread starts) so it is never silently dropped by the reader.
           Returns ``(role, banner_line)``.

        3a. If ROLE is ``RADIOBRIDGE`` (relay): ``_relay_handshake()`` sends
            ``?`` (log channel/group/mode), ``!ECHO OFF``, ``!MODE RAW250``,
            then ``!GO``.  After ``# entering data plane`` the relay is a
            transparent byte pipe.  ``self._mode`` is set to ``"direct"``
            (indistinguishable from a direct robot connection from the reader's
            perspective).

        3b. If ROLE is ``NEZHA2`` (direct robot): no ``!GO`` needed.
            ``self._mode`` is set to ``"direct"``.

        After the handshake, ``connect()`` proceeds with the PING readiness
        poll, starts the keepalive daemon, then the reader thread.

        Notes on HUPCL and DTR:
            On macOS/Linux close() pulses DTR via the HUPCL termios flag.
            For the relay this is desirable (next open will reset it again).
            For a direct robot connection it is undesirable (SET state lost).
            The ``reset`` parameter and ``_disable_hupcl`` control this.

        Radio channel note:
            Channel/group matching between relay and robot is a bench-setup
            concern.  ``_relay_handshake()`` queries and logs relay config via
            ``?`` so mismatches are visible to the operator.

        Args:
            skip_ping: When True (cache-hit fast path), skip the HELLO
                classify and readiness poll; use the cached ``self._mode``.
                The return dict will have ``lines=[]`` and ``pinged=False``.
            reset: When True, do NOT disable HUPCL — let close() pulse DTR and
                reset the device on exit.  Default False (preserve device state).
