## What It Is

radio-robot-c is a C++ firmware port of the radio-robot TypeScript/micro:bit firmware. It runs on a DFRobot QBot Pro — a micro:bit V2 paired with a Nezha V2 motor board — using the CODAL framework. The firmware receives movement and sensor commands from a Python host over serial and micro:bit radio, executes them on the robot hardware, and returns telemetry.

## Why It Exists

The original TypeScript firmware was developed as a functional prototype. This port replaces it with a clean, object-oriented C++ implementation that:

- Is maintainable and testable at the module level
- Enables advanced motor control algorithms not practical in TypeScript (ratio PID, arc-to-goal navigation)
- Runs closer to the metal for tighter timing on encoder-based odometry
- Ships a protocol v2 wire redesign with the `robot_radio/` Python host package migrated to match

## Key Technical Differentiators

**Pluggable path-following architecture.** A `PathFollower` pure-virtual interface decouples the path-following algorithm from the command processor. PurePursuit and Stanley controller implementations are provided. A `PoseProvider` pure-virtual interface similarly decouples pose estimation, with OTOS sensor and dead-reckoning implementations and a future hook for external camera pose via the SI command.

**Ratio PID motor control.** Rather than simple velocity PI with ratio cross-coupling, the firmware tracks cumulative encoder distance since each command start and applies a PID controller on the normalized distance ratio between wheels. This eliminates drift over long runs. Confirmed accuracy: 340/339 mm final encoder over a 2-second run (0.3% error).

**Arc-to-goal G command.** The G command computes an arc from the robot's current pose to a relative XY target, optionally pre-rotating when the heading error exceeds a threshold, then drives the arc using encoder targets derived from the arc geometry. This enables point-to-point navigation without continuous pose feedback.

**No heap allocation in the hot path.** All subsystem instances are static. No dynamic allocation occurs during command execution or sensor reads. The firmware targets C++14 and is built via Docker CODAL toolchain with `python build.py`.

## How Success Is Measured

- The Python host (`robot_radio/`) connects over serial at 115 200 baud and over micro:bit radio at group 10 using the protocol v2 wire format (see `docs/protocol-v2.md`).
- All command verbs (drive, stop, encoder, odometry, sensor, servo, port IO, config) produce the correct `OK`/`ERR`/`EVT`/`TLM`/`CFG`/`ID` responses defined in the v2 specification.
- The robot drives a straight 2-meter course with less than 1% encoder divergence between wheels.
- The G command navigates to a specified XY offset within the arrival tolerance (`arriveTol`) parameter.
- Clock-sync: a PING burst aligns robot `t=` timestamps with host-monotonic time to within half the minimum RTT.

## Rules vs. docs

Process and conventions agents must follow — coding standards, naming, on-chip
debugging workflow, hardware bench testing, git, CLASI — are **rules** and live in
[.claude/rules/](../.claude/rules/). `docs/` holds project knowledge: the
architecture, the protocol spec (`protocol-v4.md`, current — `protocol-v2.md`/
`protocol-v3.md` are kept as the superseded historical record), design notes, decisions, and
post-mortems. Former docs pages that became rules (`coding-standards.md`,
`debugging.md`, `hardware-bench-testing.md`) leave pointer stubs here.
